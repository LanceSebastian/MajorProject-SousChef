    * Ingredient Dialog Doesn't Close. It gets stuck completely.

RecipePage:
    * Images need work
    * Possible Feature: If user goes to another page, going back resumes progress
    * I need a unit change system, there currently isn't one in the dialogue.

    Issue for next prototype{
    * fundamental issue with ingredient is that it is not separated properly
    e.g. Multiple instances of Chicken Breast but different quantities.
    * Need to separate tables into ingredient and ingredient instance for recipe. (need good names for each)
    }

P.S. Don't forget to clean code.
