First Test - Bugs:
Auth
    O* Pressing Sign Up multiple times can create copies of the same account. (fixed: disable dialog when loading, still room for bugs tho)
Home
    o Log isn't initially read, until you move off and on it again. (Adding Loading screen to load data before anything happens)
    O Add Recipe shouldn't "createRecipe" but "selectRecipe" instead. (Unintentional fix, it doesn't do it anymore and I haven't done anything.)
    o Log Rating Bug, not saving when exiting the composable / moving onto a new log. (Fix: I changed it to update on click - with a debounce. Power to the people.)

History
    o Center "AddRecipe" Button (simply centering with column)
    o View Log doesn't navigate to the correct Log (had to create a DateViewModel that handles it.)
    o It doesn't view products

RecipePage
    o Ingredient Dialog Doesn't Close. It gets stuck completely.
    o Instruction Dialog doesn't close - except when using the phone's back function

Products
    * Product Information isn't included in the text fields

Profile
    o Username isn't being read when autologged in. (auth.currentUser is populated but the app needs to fetch the data)

Account - Currently Done:
    o Login and Signup exists, but it's remembered in UserPreferences (Finished by using Firebase Authentication.)

Home:
    o Ratings -2 - 2 (Done)
    o Need to store with JSON (Done: Made a type converter for the db)
    o Still haven't worked out the date converter (Done:
    o Bug: Notes get printed out twice - (Done: it was iterating from the amount of recipes, fixed by only using unique ids.)
    * Calendar Bug: dialog is cut a bit. Not my fault, it's Material 3
    o RecipeNotes aren't loading properly (Done: It was loading notes from recipes that weren't being used. Filtered them out.)

History:
    * Needs an empty screen

RecipePage:
    * Images need work
    * Possible Feature: If user goes to another page, going back resumes progress
    * I need a unit change system, there currently isn't one in the dialogue.
    * Currently missing a notes and history expand bar.

Profile:
    * It's completely dysfunctional.

Room Database* Switched to Firestore
    Issue for next prototype{
    * fundamental issue with ingredient is that it is not separated properly
    e.g. Multiple instances of Chicken Breast but different quantities.
    * Need to separate tables into ingredient and ingredient instance for recipe. (need good names for each)
    }

P.S. Don't forget to clean code.
